# coordinate-matrix-encryption
Code for the Coordinate Matrix Encryption scheme presented in "Using Graphic Based Systems to Improve Cryptographic Algorithms".


This code presents implementations of the CME scheme introduced in Chapman, E., (2016) "Using Graphic Based Systems to Improve Cryptographic Algorithms". Any use of the code, algorithm, or implementations should be accompanied by citation of the following papers describing the creation and use of the algorithm:

  Chapman, E. (2016). Using Graphic Based Systems to Improve Cryptographic Algorithms (Masters dissertation, Auckland University of Technology).

Implementations:
The code contains implementations of several pre-existing cryptographic standards, used for comparative purposes, including Visual Cryptography, Elliptic Curve Cryptography, AES, and RC4. The CME implementations come in multiple formats. A byte-based version of the algorithm which operates on large data or arrays of characters, and a binary string implementation which allows for the use of particularly small key sizes, primarily for proof of concept design.
